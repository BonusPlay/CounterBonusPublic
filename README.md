# CounterBonusPublic
CounterBonusPublic is a reference repository. It contains **very** basic code. The cheat does a simple bunny hop in CS:GO. There are 3 projects inside:

1. External - most basic one. 
2. External/Internal - pretty much cosmetic changes compared to External, but makes it a bit harder to detect. 
3. Internal - whole different story. Instead of overwriting memory we're hooking functions. This is the godmode. 

Note: Internal will be uploaded soon, if it's not there check again later.

### Prerequisites
  - Good knowledge of C++, ASM and reverse engineering
