# CounterBonusPublic
CounterBonusPublic is a reference repository. It contains **very** basic code. The cheat does a simple bunny hop in CS:GO. This is a public **reference** repository for anyone that wonders how stuff is done. I'm developing more complex version which you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldCezTRB_0o). There are 3 projects inside:

1. External - most basic one. 
2. External/Internal - pretty much cosmetic changes compared to External, but makes it a bit harder to detect. 
3. Internal - whole different story. Instead of overwriting memory we're hooking functions. This is the godmode. 

Note: Internal will be uploaded soon, if it's not there check again later.
